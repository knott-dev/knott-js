## Introduction

**Artis** is a tiny [**1.4 kilobytes**](https://bundlephobia.com/package/artis@1.0.2) Virtual CSS javascript library inspired from Virtual DOM. Use the custom syntax in the styling without actually writing the CSS code, **no CSS file** and **no CSS code** at all.

Simply not something like CSS-in-JS methodology, sort of.

## Benefits

- No tree-shaking CSS classes
- No Extra CSS bundling
- No CSS blocking
- No CSS codes
- Fast render
